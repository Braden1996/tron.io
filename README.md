## Abstract

A modern browser-based multiplayer implementation of the game Tron, featuring an artificial intelligence capable of competing against human users. With focus being on demonstrating the use of popular multiplayer video-game design techniques, and their implementation within a web-application. Existing solutions either rely on external browser-extensions, or lack support for multiplayer. We design and implement a web-application using common, and natively available, technologies. The result is a web-application capable of running multiple simultaneous game lobbies, enabling users to play Tron with their friends.
