# Application configuration

The application configuration has been centralised to live within the `/config/index.js` file.

Just about everything that should be reasonably configurable will be contained within here.  It even contains plugin function definitions that allow you to extend/modify the Babel and Webpack configurations.

## Goals

The goals of our application configuration are:

  - Easy to use
  - Centralised
  - Secure
  - Allows for configuration to be provided at build and execution time

## Background

Below are some of the problems that we faced, and how we ended up with our current implementation...

As this is a universal application you are mostly creating code that is shared between your "client" and "server" bundles. The "client" is sent across the wire to be executed in user's browsers therefore you have to be extra careful in what you include in the bundle.  Webpack by default bundles all code together if it is imported within your source. Therefore if you were to import the application configuration within a module that will be included in the "client" bundle, the entire application configuration would be included with your "client" bundle. This is extremely risky as the configuration exposes the internal structure of your application and may contain sensitive data such as database connection strings.

One possible solution to the above would be to use Webpack's `DefinePlugin` in order to statically inject/replace only the required configuration values into our client bundle.  However,  this solution fails to address our desire to be able to expose execution time provided values (e.g. `FOO=bar yarn run start`) to our client bundle. These environment variables can only be interpreted at runtime, therefore we decided on a strategy of making the server be responsible for attaching a configuration object to `window.__CLIENT_CONFIG__` within the HTML response.  This would then allow us to ensure that environment variables could be properly exposed.  This works well, however, it introduces a new problem:  As most of our code is in the "shared" folder you are forced to put in boilerplate code that will read the application configuration from either the `window.__CLIENT_CONFIG__` or the "config" file depending on which bundle is being built (i.e. "client" or "server").  This isn't a trivial process and is easy to get wrong.

So now we had two problems to deal with:
  1. Prevent the accidental import of the configuration object into client bundles.
  2. Provide an abstraction to the boilerplate in order to read configuration values in shared source code.

###Â Problem 1: Guarding import of the config object into client bundles.

Because we now state that our application configuration for client bundles should be a filtered object that is bound to the `window.__CLIENT_CONFIG__` within the HTTP response this problem became quite trivial to solve.  Within our `./config` file we simply put a guarded check that uses the `process.env.IS_CLIENT` flag that is provided by the Webpack `DefinePlugin`.  This boolean flag indicates whether Webpack is bundling a "client" bundle or not.  So if this flag is `true` we throw an error stating that this is a dangerous move.  This is a build time error.

### Problem 2: Abstracting access to either `window.__CLIENT_CONFIG__` or `./config`

For this we created a helper function get `safeConfigGet`.  It is located in `./src/shared/utils/config`.  You can use it like so:

```js
import { safeConfigGet } from '../shared/utils/config';

export function MyComponent() {
  return <h1>{safeConfigGet(['welcomeMessage'])}</h1>;
}
```

You must use this helper function any time you need to access configuration within the "shared" src folder.  We also recommend that you use it within any "client" source too (you could just use the `window.__CLIENT_CONFIG__` object in this case, but it is nice to keep the config access as familiar as possible throughout your source).

This does all the abstraction required, and will make sure that "problem 1" detailed above isn't hit either.

## Managing Configuration

ALL configuration should be added/managed to the `./config/index.js` file.  We even recommend that you attach environment read variables as properties to this configuration file in order to provide a familiar read API throughout your source.

### Defining the configuration values safe for client bundles

Within the bottom of the `./config/index.js` you will see that a `clientConfig` value gets exported.  This configuration value is created by providing a set of rules/filters that detail which of the configuration values you deem safe/required for inclusion in your client bundles.  Please go to this section of the configuration file for more detail on how this filtering mechanism works.

This `clientConfig` export will be serialised and attached to the `window.__CLIENT_CONFIG__` by the `reactApplication` middleware within the HTML response it returns.

## Environment Values

Environment specific values are support via host system environment variables (e.g. `FOO=bar yarn run start`) and/or by providing an "env" file.  

"env" files is an optional feature that is supported by the [`dotenv`](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv) module. This module allows you to define files containing key/value pairs representing your required environment variables (e.g. `PORT=1337`). To use this feature create an `.env` file within the root of the project (we have provided an example file called `.env_example`, which contains all the environment variables this project currently relies on).

> Note: The `.env` file has been ignored from the git repository in anticipation that it will most likely be used to house development specific configuration.

We generally recommend that you don't persist any "env" files within the repository, and instead rely on your target host environments and/or deployment servers to provide the necessary values per environment.  

If you do however have the requirement to create and persist "env" files for multiple target environments, the system does support it. To do so create a ".env" file that is postfix'ed with the environment you are targeting. For e.g. `.env.development` or `.env.staging` or `.env.production`.

Then when you run your code with the `NODE_ENV=target` set it will load the appropriate "env.target" file.

 > Note: if an environment specific configuration file exists, it will be used over the more generic `.env` file.

As stated before, the application has been configured to accept a mix-match of sources for the environment variables. i.e. you can provide some/all of the environment variables via the `.env` file, and others via the cli/host (e.g. `FOO=bar yarn run build`). This gives you greater flexibility and grants you the opportunity to control the provision of sensitive values (e.g. db connection string).  Please do note that "env" file values will take preference over any values provided by the host/CLI.

> Note: It is recommended that you bind your environment configuration values to the global `./config/values.js`. See the existing items within as an example.

## Reading Configuration

### In the "server" or "tools" source

Within the server or build tools it is safe to just import and use the configuration file directly.

```js
import config from '../../config';

// ... code bootstrapping an express instance ...

app.listen(config.port, () => console.log('Server started.'));
```

As stated in the background section above you must not import and use the config file in this manner within your "shared" source, however, don't worry about it as you will get a build time error if you accidentally did so.  The error will also include details on the proper API that you should use for the "shared" source.

### In the "client" or "shared" folders

You can't import the `./config` file in the "client" or "shared" source as this will cause build failures.  The configuration object will be bound to `window.__CLIENT_CONFIG__` as detailed in the background section above.  Therefore to access the configuration within these cases we recommend the use of our provided helper located in `./src/shared/utils/config`.

```js
import { safeConfigGet } from '../shared/utils/config';

export function MyComponent() {
  return <h1>{safeConfigGet(['welcomeMessage'])}</h1>;
}
```

The `window.__CLIENT_CONFIG__` will have the same structure as the original `./config`, however, it will only contain a subset of it (i.e. only the values you deemed safe for inclusion within the client).  

Our `safeConfigGet` allows you to specify nested path structures in the form of an array.  Say for example you wanted to access a configuration in a similar manner to the following:

```js
import config from '../../config';

console.log(config.serviceWorker.enabled);
```

You can't use the above in the "shared" or "client" code, you have to use our `safeConfigGet` helper.  You would access the same value like so:

```js
import { safeConfigGet } from '../shared/utils/config';

console.log(safeConfigGet(['serviceWorker', 'enabled']));
```

The `safeConfigGet` is also configured to throw helpful error messages when trying to request configuration values that either do not exist or have not been exposed to the client bundles.

## Config Highlights

Below are some interesting aspects of the configuration file to be aware of.

### Easily add an "API" bundle

A fairly common requirement for a project that scales is to create additional servers bundles, e.g. an API server.

Instead of requiring you to hack the Webpack configuration we have have provided a section within the centralised project configuration that allows you to easily declare additional bundles.  You simply need to provide the source, entry, and output paths - we take care of the rest.  

_IMPORTANT:_ One further requirement for this feature is that within your new server bundle you export the created http listener.  This exported listener will be used by the development server so that it can automatically restart your server any time the source files for it change.
